# Home Lab SOC Environment with SIEM Deployment

## Objective

To implement a comprehensive monitoring solution using Azure Sentinel within a home lab environment, focusing on detecting and alerting RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) logins. The project aimed to enhance security visibility by creating an alert that triggers whenever an RDP login occurs, enabling timely responses to potential unauthorized access attempts.


## Outcome

The project successfully implemented a robust monitoring solution for RDP logins using Azure Sentinel in the home lab environment. The created alerts provide real-time visibility into RDP access activities, allowing for prompt detection of potential unauthorized access and enhancing overall security posture. This setup not only improves monitoring capabilities but also serves as a practical demonstration of cloud-native security tools.
